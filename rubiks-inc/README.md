Rubiks Inc., for the purposes of this repository, is a fictional company like Microsoft's `Contoso` or `Fabrikcam`. It is the basis from which a technology stack can be built. The choice of naming is because I really enjoy solving Rubiks Cubes and collecting Rubiks Cube-related products.

## What does the fictional company Rubiks Inc. do? 

I am not sure yet, but they definitely have a technology stack and that technology stack is going to be built with, amongst other technologies, Terraform.
